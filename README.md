##Overview

This project investigates head stabilization control using a DC motor actuator. The objective is to maintain stable angular position despite disturbances by comparing three different control strategies:
PID Controller
PIV (Proportional-Integral-Velocity) Controller
MRAC (Model Reference Adaptive Control)

The system includes DC motor identification to obtain an accurate dynamic model before controller design.
The system is modeled in state-space form and evaluated based on stability, tracking performance, disturbance rejection, and robustness.

##System Modeling

DC motor mathematical modeling
Experimental motor identification for parameter estimation
State-space representation
Acceleration sensor used for feedback

##Implementation

The entire project was implemented and simulated in MATLAB, including identification, controller design, and closed-loop performance analysis.
